# odin-landing-page
Odin's Landing Page Project. 999 Hub is a website that displays information about the artist Juice WRLD.

# Project Learning Moments
I learned how to manipulate flexbox in this project so I can have elements displayed exactly where I want them. This was a CSS heavy project and I was able to improve my mastery of the language through placement of my elements.
